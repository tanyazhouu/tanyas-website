              Background information on interpreters:</em>
            In order to implement a programming language, implementing the
            compiler or interpreter is necessary so that the computer
            is able to understand and execute the source program in that
            language. Compilers/interpreters go through multiple phases when
            translating a language: lexing, parsing, semantic analysis,
            then evaluation.
            Lexing converts the source program into tokens like keywords,
            then parsing uses those tokens to construct an Abstract Syntax Tree
            (AST), which describes the structure of the program. Semantic analysis
            then checks whether the code written is valid, and finally, the program
            is executed/evaluated.
          <p class="project-description">
            In this project, the AST was implemented to allow the lexer and parser
            to create the AST, and the evaluator was also implemented to actually
            execute programs with this language. Shown in the images are the language's REPL
            (read-evaluate-print-loop) that supports basic operations along
            with more complex expressions like variable assignment, anonymous functions
            and more.

          This Pokemon game allows users to interact, catch, and fight wild Pokemon,
          with the goal of leveling up their own Pokemon to fight stronger Pokemon.
          Collaborating with a group, I was able to design the game's system through
          modules to address game features we wanted to include. For example, a
          Map module was created to handle all the functions and interactions with
          the map in the game. In addition to modular design, we leveraged
          a pre-made JSON file storing Pokemon data to construct our Pokemon.

      <h4>Challenges:</h4>
      <p class="project-description">
        A major portion of the game is the Graphical User Interface (GUI), and
        due to time constraints for the project, we decided to do a terminal-based
        map as a work-around, allowing the player to explore the map more. Another
        challenge we encountered was issues with mutability; for instance, if
        a Pokemon lost health during a battle, the Pokemon's health would return
        to its original value after the battle. So maintaining effects after changes
        were made to Pokemon was one issue we often encountered.

            This search engine returns the names of text files that include
            the words in the provided query. Different queries can be entered
            to obtain results; the "and" query followed by some words will
            look for files that contain all words in the query, while the "or" query
            will look for files that contain <em>any</em> of the words in the query.
            The queries can also include "not" words, in which if files contain
            the words of the "not" query, they will be excluded from the search result.
          </p>
          <p class="project-description">
            In building the search engine, a dictionary interface was created using both
            an OCaml association list (linked list) approach and a tree-based approach.
            The association list approach uses keys and values to create the dictionary
            and leverages OCaml's higher order functions like "fold_left" or "map" to
            satisfy required dictionary functions. The tree-based approach uses a "Leaf" type
            and a "Node" type, containing the node's color (red or black), key-value pair,
            and a left child and right child. This tree-based approach for the search engine
            yields better performance due to the logarithmic performance it provides in its
            operations.
